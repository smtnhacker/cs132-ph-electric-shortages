## Post-Processing

This directory contains the scripts used to post-process all scraped data. Each script is named identically to the data file it processes. All outputs will be stored in the `out` folder in this directory, with the same file name as its script.



The list of sample data to help in creating the post-processors can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YIvqTxgiY1DS0fBB8v0yPlLavl3oAjDn?usp=sharing).
