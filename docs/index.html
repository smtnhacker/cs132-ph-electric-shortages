                              2022. Chi-square tests reveal no significant
                              difference in the distribution of peaks between
                              Private and Public cooperatives, and only a weak

                              Public cooperatives seem to have significant peaks
                              which are much higher than their average peak
                              (e.g. June 2023 an August 2023). Studying the
