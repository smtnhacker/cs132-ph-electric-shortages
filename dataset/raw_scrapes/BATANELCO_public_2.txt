b"Salute to all our brave Line Workers!\n\nAugust 7, 2023 \xe2\x80\x93 Batanelco celebrated the Line Worker Appreciation Day at Boulder Bay Residences, a heartfelt tribute to the indomitable spirit and tireless dedication of our line workers who continuously illuminate our lives by ensuring the seamless flow of electricity.\n\nThe day commenced with a Lineman Virtual Activity hosted by the Philippine Rural Electric Cooperatives Association (PHILRECA) via Zoom, uniting line workers from across the nation in a simultaneous commemoration of their vital role. In the afternoon, BATANELCO held its special program highlighting the lives of BATANELCO Line Workers through several messages and a video presentation.\n\nMr. Joseph Caliguiran, the esteemed General Manager of Landbank of the Philippines (Basco Branch), graced the event as the guest speaker. In his heartfelt address, Mr. Caliguiran shared his personal journey, recalling a time when he, too, voiced complaints during power outages. However, through a firsthand understanding of the challenges and sacrifices undertaken by line workers, his perspective shifted. He emphasized the paramount importance of electricity in our daily lives, particularly in business operations, underscoring the indispensable role played by line workers. Mr. Caliguiran commended these dedicated individuals for their unwavering commitment and selfless contributions, igniting a fire of inspiration to persist in their noble profession.\n\nMoreover, the afternoon program was brimmed with gratitude and recognition for the unwavering commitment and hard work of our line workers through messages from the department heads, Engr. Donald B. Poncio, Technical Services Department (TSD) Manager, Ms. Marilys G. Ponce, Institutional Services Department (ISD) Manager, and Mr. Bonifacio Aguas, Finance Services Department (FSD) Manager, and from the Hon. Ciriaco B. Gato, Congressman, Lone District of Batanes represented by Ms. Leticia Bayaras.\n\nThe Board and Management showed its continued support and pride for Batanelco line workers as Dir. Ramonito Imperial, President of the Board of Directors, and Victoria A. Mata, General Manager delivered their respective messages, lauding the line workers' relentless efforts and sacrifices in the electrification movement. Their steadfast and fearless service was duly recognized and commended.\n\nA video presentation showcasing the achievements and contributions of linemen from different MCO\xe2\x80\x99s was also imparted. During the ceremony, all line workers were given tokens of appreciation presented by GM Mata and Department Managers.\n\nThis annual event was conducted by BATANELCO thru its Institutional Services Department led by Ms. Marilys G. Ponce, ISD Manager, in accordance with the House Bill No. 472 or \xe2\x80\x9cAn Act Proclaiming The First Monday of August Every Year as Linemen Appreciation Day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was a memorable day, celebrating appreciation, team spirit, and the invaluable contributions of line workers not only to Batanelco's success but also to the welfare of the community. To the men who truly embody the spirit of modern-day heroes, Dios mamahes!"

Dahil dito, ang power operation sa Itbayat ay paiiksiin pa. Simula ngayon araw, magkakaroon na lamang ng anim (6) na oras na power operation mula alas kwatro ng umaga (4:00 AM) hanggang alas siete ng umaga (7:00 AM) at mula ala sais ng gabi (6:00 PM) hanggang alas nuebe ng gabi (9:00 PM).

b"BANDILLO!

Kaya bilang pansamantalang solusyon at upang maiwasan ang pagkakaroon ng total blackout, magpapatupad ang Itbayat Diesel Power Plant (Itbayat DPP)  ng pagpapaiksi ng power operation simula bukas, December 9, 2022. Magkakaroon na lamang ng walong (8) oras na power operation, mula alas dos ng hapon (2:00PM) hanggang alas dyes ng gabi (10:00PM).\n\nAng nabanggit na schedule ng power operation ay mananatili hangga't wala pang dumarating na fuel;\n\n\xf0\x9f\x93\x8dSa parehong kadahilanan, ang Sabtang Diesel Power Plant (Sabtang DPP) ay magbabawas pa ng operating hours. Mula sa naunang implementasyon ng 16-hr power operation, gagawing anim (6) na oras lamang ito ngayong araw December 8, 2022. Mula alas kwstro ng hapon (4:00 PM) hanggang alas dies ng gabi (10:00 PM). At simula bukas December 9, 2022, gagawin na lamang po itong apat (4) na oras na power operation, mula alas singko ng hapon (5:00 PM) hanggang  alas nwebe ng gabi (9:00 PM).\n\n\xf0\x9f\x93\x8dSamantala, mananatiling bente kwatro (24) oras ang power operation sa Batan Island dahil sapat pa naman ang fuel stock para sa Batan ayon sa Basco Diesel Power Plant (Basco DPP).\n\nMuli hinihiling po namin ang inyong lubos na pang-unawa at konsiderasyon.\n\nSumasainyo,\nBATANELCO Management"

b"POWER ADVISORY\n\nMga Kaalaman at Paalala sa Panahon ng Brownout dulot ng Fuel Shortage:\n\n1. Bagamat 1PM ang nakalathalang pagsisimula ng power operation, hindi kaya ng genset ng NAPOCOR ang load ng buong isla sa isang bagsakang 'power on'. Kinakailangang unti-unting ipasok ang load upang maiwasan ang overloading at mapangalagaan ang mga genset. Kaya naman sa sistema ng power restoration ay hinahati-hati sa pangkat o section ang distribution system dahilan ng hindi pagkasabay-sabay ng iba't ibang lugar, barangay at munisipyo sa pagpa-power on. Ang ibang lugar ay mahuhuling magkaroon ng power habang umiikot ang ating mga lineman.\n\n2. Makakatulong din ang pagtanggal sa saksakan ng ating mga appliances upang hindi ma-overload ang ating mga transformers tuwing magpa-power on. Kapag na overload ang transformer, maaring magdulot ng mas matagalang brownout sa isang lugar.\n\n3. Sa mga gumagamit ng generator o solar, tiyakin na may double throw o automatic transfer switch para sa ating kaligtasan at sa kaligtasan na din ng ating mga lineworkers. Kapag walang konektadong double throw, sa oras na mawala ang power mula sa distribution service at gumamit ng genset, maaring ma-energize o magkaroon ng pagdaloy ng kuryente mula sa genset pabalik sa ating mga linya na maaring makadisgrasya sa ating mga lineworkers sa panahon ng pagkukumpuni. Maaring sumangguni sa Batanelco kung hindi kayo sigurado o kailangan ninyo ng tulong ukol dito."

b"UPDATE:\n\nSa mga minamahal naming Batanelco  Member-Consumer Owners sa Batan island, Sabtang at Itbayat\n\nNais po naming ipagbigay-alam na ang Amendment Order (AO) ng diesel fuel ng NaPoCor para sa mga planta sa Batanes ay aprubado na. Subalit dahil sa sama ng panahon, nagkaroon ng port congestion kaya't maaantala ang pagkakarga at pagpapadala ng diesel fuel papunta dito sa ating probinsya.\n \nBilang pansamantalang solusyon, paiiksiin ang oras ng power operation simula bukas, September 4, 2022.

b"Sa mga minamahal naming Member-Consumer Owners ng BATANELCO  sa Batan, Sabtang at Itbayat\n\nIpinapabatid sa ating lahat na mula ika-2 ng Septyembre 2022 ang pamunuan ng National Power Corporation (NPC) ay magpapatupad ng pagbabawas o pagpapaiksi ng oras ng power operation sa isla ng Batan, Sabtang at Itbayat. Mayroon lang po tayong power operation mula ala singko y media ng umaga (5:30AM) hanggang alas dose ng hating gabi(12MN). Ito ay dahil sa epekto ng malawakang krisis  sa krudo sa buong bansa kasama dito ang ating natatanging pinagkukunan na diesel fuel. Dahil sa biglaang pagtaas ng presyo ng diesel fuel sa pang daigdigang kalakaran gayun din sa bansa, ang nakalaang kabuuang pondo ng NPC para sa diesel fuel sa 2022 ay nagamit na kaya nagresulta ng fuel shortage.\n\nSa ngayon ay hinihintay pa rin ng NPC ang approval ng Amendment to Order(AO) ng diesel para sa probinsya ng Batanes na siyang isu-suplay ng Petron Corporation.\n\nSinisikap ng pamunuan ng NPC na ma resolba ang kasalukuyang sitwasyon na ating kinakaharap.\n\nAng nasabing schedule ng power operation ay mananatili hangga't wala pang dumarating na panibagong supply ng diesel fuel ang NPC.\n\nMuli hinihiling po namin ang inyong lubos na pang-unawa.\n\nSumasainyo,\nBATANELCO Management"

b'Salute to all our brave Linemen!\n\nAugust 1, 2022. BATANELCO thru its Institutional Services Department conducted a program in celebration of the National Linemen Appreciation Day in accordance with the House Bill No. 472 or \xe2\x80\x9cAn Act Proclaiming The First Monday of August Every Year as Linemen Appreciation Day.\xe2\x80\x9d This occasion has been commemorated since 2020 to give way to the rigorous efforts of the linemen who work day and night to ensure power in every household.\n \nThe program started thru the Opening Remarks of Ms. Karen C. Nico, Human Resource Management Officer, followed by an inspirational message by Dir. Catherine C. De Mata, BOD President. Thereafter, all linemen and technical personnel were given certificates and token of appreciation. The program became more meaningful as messages from various Member-Consumer-Owners poured-in appreciating their efforts in giving convenience to the daily lives of the Ivatan community. The Hon. Ciriaco Gato, Congressman of the Lone District of Batanes, forwarded a message wherein he expressed his thankfulness on the work of linemen in the development of the province. Further, messages of encouragement and gratitude were delivered by Victoria A. Mata, General Manager and Engr. Donald B. Poncio, Technical Services Department Manager. Ms. Marilys G. Ponce, Institutional Services Department Manager concluded the program with her closing remarks.\n\nMoreover, the Linemen Appreciation Day program was simultaneously held around the country via Zoom platform. This year, one of its highlights is the \xe2\x80\x98Gawad ng Parangal Para Sa Mga Natatanging Linemen\xe2\x80\x99 which aims to give recognition to linemen who have proven their outstanding performance throughout their years of service. The Philippine Rural Electric Cooperatives Association (PHILRECA) set the criteria for selection and have encouraged the 121 Electric Cooperatives to send their nominees. There were 43 awardees including our Batanelco representative and Construction Foreman, Mr. Josue A. Ponce, in which his awarding was done concurrently. He then had his acceptance speech and he emphasized that his co-lineworkers have contributed to his achievements therefore, they (all linemen) also deserve to be awardees.\n\nOur linemen are undeniably dedicated and persevered to serve our consumers despite risks and hazard of their work and it is seen in their impact to the community. To the menfolks who truly embody our modern-day heroes, Dios mamahes!\n\nHappy Linemen Appreciation Day!!'

b'Ang buwan ng Hunyo ay idineklara ng PHILRECA at NAGMEC na "Electric Cooperative (EC) General Manager\'s Month" bilang pagkilala sa liderato at serbisyo ng mga General Manager ng Electric Cooperatives sa bansa.\n\nSa pangalawang taon ng paggunita nito, nagsagawa ng sorpresang programa para kay GM Vicky ang mga empleyado ng Batanelco sa pangunguna ng Institutional Services Department. Nagkaroon ng simpleng pagtatanghal ang bawat departamento at nagbigay ng mensahe ang mga Department Managers/Representatives na sina Bonifacio Aguas, OIC ng Finance Services Department, Marilys G. Ponce, Manager ng Institutional Services Department, Josue Ponce ng Technical Services Department at Engr. Lynne Zhaine Gonzales ng Office of the General Manager.

b'Climbing Off the Pole of Duty\n\nMR. RODEN T. SURBAN, \xe2\x80\x9cUmban\xe2\x80\x9d as referred by his colleagues is a Warrior of Light who surfaced diligence and dedication to his work as lineman. He started working as a casual employee in Batanelco on September 1, 2006. During those times, the Coop experienced struggles and downfalls due to crisis management, months of rotational brownouts caused by the insufficiency of fuel of NPC, deterioration of power lines as well as strong typhoons resulting to severe damages on the distribution facilities. His daily life as lineman was a 24/7 on-call duty that was super busy and tiring. But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t let these discourage him, instead, he dedicated his full efforts to help in the daily operations.\n\nHe is known to be the model of punctuality and on-the-go attitude. With his extra skill in welding, he made other activities of the Coop more convenient. He became a recipient of a 10-Year Loyalty Award during the conduct of Annual General Membership Assembly in 2016. Behind his serious face is a jolly person who sees positivity in a stressful workday which powers smiles and laughter around him.\n\nThank you for sharing 15 years, 6 months, 30 days of service and friendship. You will always belong here in BATANELCO! Once a lineman, always a lineman.\n\nHappy Retirement! Kudos, Sir Umban! \xe2\x80\x93 Ang ating magiting na Sundalo ng Pailaw ng BATANELCO!'

b'Mga Minamahal na Member-Consumer-Owners,\n\nSa pagpapatuloy ng pagkukumpuni ng ating distribution system sa Batan Island, asahan natin ang pagkawala ng kuryente ano mang oras. May mga pagkakataon ng kinakailangang i-off ang kuryente upang maging ligtas ang paggawa. Bagamat nanumbalik na ang serbisyo ng kuryente sa Basco, hindi pa natin ito masasabing "Normal Operation" kaya naman ito ang dahilan ng pagkakaroon ng mga biglaang brownout.\n\nMaraming salamat sa inyong pang-unawa!'

b"Mga minamahal na Member-Consumer-Owners, \n\nNais naming paliwanagan ang lahat patungkol sa sistema ng ating power restoration. Nauna ng nailahad na ito ay nakabase sa Order of Priorities at kahandaan ng mga linya at kaakibat nito ang YARU Schedule na naibigay na sa inyong kanya-kanyang Barangay.\n\nIbig sabihin, kung ngayong araw ang schedule sa inyong lugar, ang backbone/major lines ang prioridad na ayusin, sunod ang mga vital establishments, water systems, at isasabay na rin ang mga malalapit na household. Sa pagkakataong ito, ang mga HANDANG METRO AT SERVICE ENTRANCE LAMANG ang mga KAKABITAN at ang lahat ng HINDI PA HANDA ay BABALIKAN sa ibang araw ng ating Service-Dropping Technical Team. Ang lahat naman ng naka-STANDARD METERING ay kailangang PUMASA muna sa INSPEKSYON bago kabitan.\n\nKung hindi pasado sa inspeksyon o kinailangan mang ayusin ang inyong metro/service entrance, sa oras na handa na ito at hindi na schedule ng Technical Team sa inyong lugar, mababalikan pa rin po ito ngunit ang priority na natin sa araw na iyon ay ang naka schedule na ibang lugar. Kaya't paumanhin man po kung hindi agad mababalikan.\n\nNililinaw po namin na wala pong palakasan at pinipiling estado ng buhay ang Batanelco sa pagpapailaw. Lalong lalo na ay hindi tumatanggap ng suhol ang Batanelco para lamang mapabilis ang pagpapakabit. Kayong mga Member-Consumer-Owners ay pantay-pantay ang karapatan sa ating Kooperatiba. Ang anumang reklamo o galit ninyo sa amin ay hindi rin nakakaapekto sa aming pananaw sa inyo. Mananatili kayong Member-Consumer-Owners ng Batanelco na nararapat na mapailawan. Sadyang sa panahon nga lang ng kalamidad ay may mga sinusunod tayong patakaran upang mas mapabilis ang ating trabaho.\n\nGustuhin man namin na magawa agad lahat ng inyong hiling, ito ang mabigat na desisyon ng Batanelco na kailangan ang laging isinasaalang-alang ay ang kapakanan ng nakararami at hindi ng indibidwal na kagustuhan lamang. Lahat po tayo ay papailawan. Hintayin lang po sana natin ang ating schedule.\n\nSa Batan Island, mayroon lamang tayong 16 na linemen na nakatutok sa pagkumpuni ng major lines at 7 na manggagawa ng Service Dropping Team. Ang oras ng kanilang trabaho ay 7AM-7PM. Ang bawat minuto sa schedule ay mahalagang matutukan at masundan. Totoong nais naming isagad ang oras para mas maraming mapailawan, subalit sana'y maintindihan din po natin na kailangang isaalang-alang din ang kalusugan ng ating manggagawa. \n\nKami po ay palaging bukas sa inyong mga tanong, concern, reklamo at suhestyon. Ngunit sana ay maging marahan tayo sa ating pananalita. Kasinghalaga ng physical health ang mental health lalong lalo na sa sitwasyon ngayon.\n\nSa araw-araw, tinataya ng ating mga sundalo sa pailaw, frontline health workers at iba pang essential workers ang kanilang buhay sa delikadong sitwasyon na ito dala ng pandemya. At sa kabila ng hindi matatawaran na sakripisyo at dedikasyon na kanilang ginagampanan, nawa'y pag-isipan natin kung makakabuti ba ang bawat mapanakit na salitang ating ituturan. Tao din sila na napapagod at may pamilyang umaasang makakauwi sila ng ligtas.\n\nSa panahon ngayon, higit nating kailangan ang pang-unawa at pagkakaisa. Ang tanging paraan upang malagpasan natin ang pagsubok na ito ay sa pamamagitan ng pagtutulungan at pagsunod sa mga naaayong pamamaraan. Nawa'y magpatuloy tayo ng may iisang hangarin na mapabuti ang ating komunidad.\n\nMaraming salamat! \n\n#BatanesMulingTatanglawan\n\nALAMIN\nIto ang mga maaring dahilan kung bakit hindi kapa nagkailaw gayung meron naman ng kuryente sa inyong lugar:\n1. Hindi pa handa ang metro/service entrance\n2. Hindi pumasa sa inspeksyon at kailangan pang ayusin (para sa STANDARD METERING) \n3. Noong schedule sa inyong lugar, hindi na naituloy dahil masyado ng madilim at delikado ang pagtatrabaho sa lugar\n4. Wala pang available na metro\n\nSa ngayon, ang Batanelco ay kulang sa suplay ng metro. Ngunit nagpakuha na tayo sa Maynila at inaasahan naman ang pagdating nito ngayong araw lulan ng barkong Everwin 3.\n\nHabang inaantay natin ang schedule ng pagpapailaw sa ating lugar, narito ang ilang paghahanda na maari nating gawin:\n1. Pagkumpuni ng service entrance\n2. Clearing ng daanan ng service drop at lokasyon ng metro/service entrance\n3. Kung naka parallel connection kayo sa kalapit na bahay, siguruhing handa ang parehong metro/service entrance pwera na lang kung hindi talaga maaring kumpunihin o pailawan ang isa\n\nKung may tubig, basag o sira ang metro, ipagbigay alam agad sa Batanelco coordinator sa araw ng inyong schedule.\n\nAntabayanan ang iba pang updates patungkol sa ating Power Restoration."

b"Mga minamahal na Member-Consumer-Owners,\n\nNais po naming ipaunawa na ang pagkakasunud-sunod ng pag-restore ng kuryente sa bawat lugar sa Batan Island ay nakabase sa Order of Priorities na nailahad bago pa ang bagyo at nakasalalay din sa kahandaan ng linya sa isang lugar.\n\nDahil sa COVID-19 Pandemic, hindi hinihikayat ng lokal na pamahalaan na magpadala ng Task Force Kapatid dito sa ating probinsya para na rin sa ating kaligtasan. Kaya naman nagpapatupad ng YARU (Bayanihan) Power Restoration ang Batanelco sa tulong ng ating mga barangay.  \n\nSa ating sitwasyon ngayon, nawa'y ating intindihin kung mabagal man ang ating power restoration dahil marami tayong kailangan isaalang-alang tulad na lang ng bilang ng manggagawa, kaligtasan sa paggawa at lala ng sira ng linya sa isang lugar.\n\nKaya't huwag po sana tayong magalit kung nauna mang mapailawan ang ibang lugar o ang kapitbahay niyo.  \n\nSisikapin ng Batanelco na mapanumbalik ang serbisyo ng kuryente sa lahat ng mga konsumidores nito sa pinakamaagang pagkakataon ng may kaakibat na pag-iingat at pagsunod sa ating health safety protocol.\n\nOrder of Priorities:\n1) Backbone Lines\n2) Hospitals & Health Stations\n3) Communication Facilities\n4) Water Systems\n5) Evacuation Centers\n6) Municipal Buildings\n7) Municipal Poblacions\n8) Barangay along Backbone Lines\n9) Commercial Loads\n10) Interior Barangays\n11) Other Residential Areas\n12) Other Loads\n\nMaraming salamat sa inyong pang-unawa.\n\n#BatanesMulingTatanglawan"

b"SUPER TYPHOON KIKO STRIKES, CAUSES TOTAL BLACKOUT\n\nThe raging Super Typhoon Kiko caused total blackout on the three franchise areas of Batanelco namely, Batan Island, Sabtang Island and Itbayat Island on September 11, 2021.\n\nSabtang has restored its power in Barangay Malakdang and Sinakan the next day and Itbayat resumed its operation on September 13, 2021 with the energization of Plaza Sectionalizer which comprises parts of Barangay San Rafael, Sta. Lucia and Sta. Maria. The early power restoration in the islands of Sabtang and Itbayat is the advantage of having the Underground Distribution System for both primary and secondary lines and in the case of Sabtang, service laterals are also utilized. \n\nWhereas, Batan Island is still on shutdown after Typhoon Kiko ravaged the switchyard of the National Power Corporation (NPC) and Batanelco\xe2\x80\x99s Take-Off Sectionalizers of both Basco Feeder and South Feeder. Although Batan Island\xe2\x80\x99s primary backbone are underground, the lines serving the poblacions, sitios and barrios are still overhead which were greatly affected during the typhoon. NPC and Batanelco are the sole power supplier and distributor in the island, respectively. Hence, power restoration can only depend on the completion of reconstructing the NPC and Batanelco\xe2\x80\x99s facilities.\n\nBatanelco estimates a total damage cost of Php 45 Million combined Network and Non-Network Assets.\n\nHere are the photos of NPC Power Plant and Batanelco Take Off Sectionalizers in Batan Island. We'll upload more photos as soon as the internet connection becomes stable.\n\n And we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted on the status of power restoration"

b'By virtue of Proclamation No. 1743 signed in March 2009 by then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo declared August of every year as the \xe2\x80\x9cNATIONAL ELECTRIFICATION AWARENESS MONTH\xe2\x80\x9d (NEAM) coinciding with the anniversary of the National Electrification Administration 9NEA), to which recognizes the significant contributions of electrification program in nation building.\n\nAs we end this year\xe2\x80\x99s month-long celebration, here is a recap of the activities we have conducted:\n \nNATIONAL LINEMEN APPRECIATION DAY\nBatanelco organized a program to commemorate one of the essential front line workers, the linemen, for their dedication and sacrifices in bringing a bright electric service to the community. As one of the highlights of the event, former Batanelco lineman, Sir Sanson Cantero gave a brief and yet strong message to our linemen inspiring them to become more passionate on their profession.\nPresentation video was prepared showing their risky job. Appreciation messages from the local government officials and from their families were also viewed and some parents also attended to personally give their message to them. Retired linemen were also present during the event.\nDir. Catherine De Mata and GM Vicky Mata also gave their encouraging and thank you messages. They highlighted the sacrifices, contributions and importance of our linemen not only to Batanelco but to the whole community.\n\nNATIONWIDE SIMULTANEOUS LINE CLEARING AND TREE PLANTING\nIn coordination with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) - Batanes, this year, we have planted a total of 650 Palo Maria (Vutalaw) seedlings as follows: Batan Island - 350 seedlings at Vayang, Basco; Sabtang Island \xe2\x80\x93 150 seedlings at Hakawan Malakdang; and Itbayat Island - 150 seedlings at Kavaywan, Raele.\nLine clearing ensued wherein our Member-Consumer-Owners and Barangay Officials assisted during implementation.\n\nFREE SEMINAR ON STANDARD METERING\nBatanelco conducted a FREE Seminar on Standard Metering for a total of 47 private electricians in the province. Topics discussed were: 1) Relevant BATANELCO Policies on Standard Metering; 2) How to Interpret & Layout Electrical Plans; and 3) Career & Learning Opportunities for Electricians. A comprehensive explanation of the \xe2\x80\x98Service Entrance and House Wiring Inspection Checklist\xe2\x80\x99 was also given and then followed by the open forum which was actively participated by our electricians.\nMoreover, Batanelco took the opportunity to initiate the creation of the Association of Recognized Batanelco Electricians in which they were able to elect their officers.\n\nThese series of activities were organized by the Institutional Services Department (ISD) led by Marilys G. Ponce, Officer-In-Charge ISD and with the help of the 3 other departments namely, Office of the General Manager, Technical Services Department (TSD) led by Engr. Donald B. Poncio, and Finance Services Department (FSD) led by Bobby Tambis, Officer-In-Charge FSD.\n\nThe success of these events was made possible thru the continuous support of the Batanelco Board and Management spearheaded by Dir.

b'Challenergy\xe2\x80\x99s 10-kW MAGNUS VAWT Inaugurated in Batanes, First in the Philippines\n\nAugust 25, 2021. Today marks a great day in history as the inauguration of the Challenergy\xe2\x80\x99s 10-kW MAGNUS Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT), a pioneer project in the country, took place at Naidi Hills, Basco, Batanes.\n\nThis is a demonstration project aimed to test the structure and the performance of the technology. It will initially cater the loads of the newly installed lighting system at the Basco Lighthouse Vicinity and eventually adding other loads within the area once the system has stabled its output. Apart from the conventional type wind turbines, the MAGNUS VAWT has a unique appearance purposedly designed to be typhoon-proof. Accordingly, the wind turbine has a minimum start-up wind speed requirement of around 14 km/h (4 m/s) and is expected to withstand a Category 5 typhoon.\n\nThis exceptional renewable energy technology feature was invented by the brilliant minds of the Challenergy Inc.\xef\xbc\x88\xe6\xa0\xaa\xe5\xbc\x8f\xe4\xbc\x9a\xe7\xa4\xbe\xe3\x83\x81\xe3\x83\xa3\xe3\x83\xac\xe3\x83\x8a\xe3\x82\xb8\xe3\x83\xbc\xef\xbc\x89  Japan engineers and entrepreneurs headed by their President and CEO, Atsushi Shimizu. The project was funded by the Japanese Ministry of Environment, jointly implemented by the Challenergy Philippines Inc.  and Challenergy Japan and was contracted by ATV Engineering Services, Inc.\n\nIn August 2020, Challenergy, Inc. signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Provincial Government of Batanes (PG Batanes), represented by the good Governor, Marilou Cayco, with the Municipality of Basco, represented by the good Mayor, Demetrius Paul Narag, and with the Batanes Electric Cooperative (BATANELCO), represented by GM Victoria Mata, to implement this demonstration project.\n\nGM Vicky emphasized in her speech the impacts, benefits of this kind of technology and how blessed we are to have been granted this kind of project. She continued on thanking each party who have been part of the success of this project especially the Challenergy Team and ended her message expressing her continuous support on any future engagements on renewable energy technologies which will be beneficial to the community.\n\nDios mamahes, Challenergy!'

b'The 2021 NATIONAL LINEMEN APPRECIATION DAY!! \n\nAng pagiging isang lineman ay isang marangal na propesyon:\n\nSa oras na naiinitan tayo pag walang kuryente, nandyan ang mga masisipag na linemen na literal na naiinitan ng araw sa pagkumpuni ng anumang sira sa linya;\n\nSa gabi at hatinggabi na biglang dumilim ang paligid dahil sa pagkawala ng kuryente, nandyan ang matityagang linemen na rumiresponde upang tulog natin ay maging mahimbing kahit na ang tanging gabay nila ay ang dalang flashlight at ilaw na mula sa buwan;\n\nSa sama ng panahon, nandyan ang mga palaban na linemen na hinaharap ang bagsik ng hangin, lakas ng ulan at sungit ng dagat upang maproteksyonan, mapanatili at maibalik ang ating kuryente;\n\nSa oras ng sakuna, nandyan ang mga laging handa na linemen, tutulong at susulong para sa kagustuhan nating maging tuluy tuloy ang paggamit ng kuryente sa kabahayan; Walang pinipiling oras, araw at panahon, ON-CALL ika nga;\n\nAng powerline construction ay mahirap at napakadelikadong trabaho. Sa oras ng paggawa, ang isang paa nila ay nasa hukay na. Nakakangatog umakyat sa poste at mas lalong nakakangatog kapag nakuryente. Pero tunay ngang walang katumbas ang kanilang tapang dahil sinusuong nila ang lahat para lang mapanatili ang serbisyo ng kuryente kahit pa may nakaambang panganib.\n\nNakakapagod, at sa kabila ng lahat, kailangan pa rin nilang harapin ang pinakamatinding hamon \xe2\x80\x93 na makabalik ng ligtas sa kani-kanilang mga pamilya at mahal sa buhay.\n\nMAGITING, MATAPANG!
