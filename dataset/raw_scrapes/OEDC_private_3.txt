b'OEDC Comparative Rates for February - March 2023\n\nNais po naming ipaalam sa mga minamahal naming consumers na nagkaroon ng Php 6.8957 na pagbaba sa presyo ng kuryente per kWh ngayong March billing month sa Php 12.34/kWh kumpara sa Php 19.23/kWh para sa February billing month.\n\nNananatili naman sa Php 1.1210/kWh at hindi nagbabago simula pa noong 2018 ang singil sa distribution charge ng OEDC.\n\nPara sa karagdagang katanungan ay maaaring tumawag sa aming opisina. Maraming salamat po.'
b'MAHALAGANG ABISO SA MGA KONSYUMER\n\nNais po naming ipaabot sa lahat na ngayong buwan ng Marso 2023, ang presyo ng kuryente ay Php 12.3356/kWh para sa residential konsyumer na kumukunsumo ng 200 kWh. Ito ay mas mababa ng Php 6.8957 kumpara noong Pebrero 2023. \n\nIto ang naging resulta ng pag-uusap at kasunduan ng mga kinatawan ng lokal na pamahalaan ng Zambales, OEDC, ZAMECO I, ZAMECO II at SMC Global Power Holdings Corporation (SMCGPH). Napagkasunduan ang Php 6.00 na kabawasan para sa buwan ng Marso 2023 upang maibsan ang naging pagtaas noong nakaraang buwan. Sa buwan ng Abril 2023 ay magkakaroon ng humigit kumulang Php 4.00 na pagbaba sa presyo kumpara sa buwan ng Pebrero. Itong pagbaba ng presyo ay sa pamamagitan ng pagpapaliban ng pagsingil ng kabuuang Generation Charge.\n\nAng kasalukuyang pagpapaliban ng pagsingil ng kabuuang generation charges ay pagpapatuloy sa nasimulang pagpapaliban ng pagsingil ng buong generation charge mula noong Setyembre 2022 at mananatili hanggang Disyembre 2023. Ang halagang ito na hindi pa nasisingil ay unti-unting idadagdag sa buwanang bayarin sa mga susunod na taon. Layunin ng hakbang na ito na pansamantalang maibsan ang bigat na nararanasan ng mga konsyumer  dulot ng mataas na presyo ng kuryente at iba pang bilihin.\n\nMuli ay pinapayuhan namin ang lahat na patuloy na magtipid at magsinop sa paggamit ng kuryente upang hindi mabigla sa bayarin.\n\nPara sa mga katanungan kaugnay dito ay maaaring makipag-ugnayan sa aming opisina. Maraming salamat po.'

b'MAHALAGANG PABATID SA MGA CONSUMERS\n\nNais po naming ipabatid sa aming mga consumers na nagkaroon po ng bahagyang pagtaas sa generation charge ngayong buwan ng Agosto. Ang generation charge ay ang halagang ibinabayad ng OEDC sa supplier ng kuryente. Ang pagtaas na ito ay bunsod nang pagtaas ng presyo ng coal sa pandaigdigang merkado. Ang supply ng kuryente ng Olongapo ay nanggagaling sa Sual II Power Plant na gumagamit ng coal upang gumawa ng kuryente.\n\nMay pagtaas rin sa singil ng transmission charge na ibinabayad naman ng buo sa National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) para sa kanilang serbisyo. \n\nAng mga government charges naman ay ang mga halagang ibinabayad ng buo sa iba\xe2\x80\x99t ibang ahensya ng gobyerno gaya ng BIR, PSALM, TransCo at lokal na pamahalaan ng Olongapo.\n\nSamantala, ang distribution charge na sinisingil ng OEDC ay hindi pa nagbabago simula pa noong June 2018. Ito ay ang halagang ginagamit ng OEDC sa kanyang operasyon.\n\nPara sa kumpletong detalye sa mga charges na nakapaloob sa inyong OEDC billing statement bisitahin ang link na ito:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OEDCOfficial/photos/a.285291334952486/2179299942218273/\n\nPara naman sa karagdagang katanungan, maaaring makipag-ugnayan sa aming opisina.'

Bukod pa rito ay isinusulong din ang paggamit ng mga indigenous at renewable energy resources sa paggawa ng kuryente upang mabawasan ang pag-angkat ng enerhiya mula sa labas. \n\nAlinsunod sa Section 9, Chapter 3 ng Republic Act 9513 o Renewable Energy Act of 2008, ang Department of Energy ay naatasan na isaayos ang Green Energy Option Program (GEOP). Ang GEOP ay isang programa na nagbibigay sa mga konsyumers ng karapatang mamili ng Renewable Energy resources na maaari nilang pagkuhanan ng kuryente.\n\nAng mga sumusunod ay ang mga kwalipikadong consumers na maaaring lumahok sa ilalim ng GEOP:\n1. Mga consumers na may buwanang konsumo na katumbas o higit pa sa 100 kW sa \nnakaraang labingdalawang (12) buwan\n\n2.

b'MAHALAGANG PAALALA SA MGA CONSUMERS\n\nNais po naming ipagbigay-alam na ang presyo ng ating kuryente (Php/kWh) para sa buwan ng Hulyo ay Php 17.22/kWh. Nagkaroon ng pagtaas  sa generation charge, transmission charge at kaakibat na Value Added Tax. \n\nAng pangunahing dahilan ng pagtaas ng generation rate ay bunsod ng patuloy na pagtaas ng presyo ng coal at  fuel sa pandaigdigang merkado. Ang supply ng kuryente ng Olongapo ay nanggagaling sa Sual II Power Plant na gumagamit ng coal upang gumawa ng kuryente. \n\nNoong 2020, ang presyo ng coal ay nasa $50/metric ton lamang. Ito ay pumalo na sa $432/metric ton ngayong Hulyo 2022. Kasabay pa nito ay ang patuloy na pagtaas ng presyo ng fuel na ginagamit din sa operasyon ng planta ng kuryente. Gayundin naman ang presyo ng palitan ng dolyar na dating nasa halos Php 49.00 ay umabot na ngayon sa Php56.00. Dahil sa di pagkakaunawaan sa pagitan ng Russia at Ukraine na syang pangunahing producer ng coal ay nagkaroon ng kakulangan ng supply ng coal sa buong mundo. Ito ang naging pangunahing sanhi ng patuloy na pagtaas ng presyo ng coal sa pandaigdigang pamilihan.\n\nKaugnay dito, pinapayuhan namin ang lahat na patuloy na magtipid at magsinop sa paggamit ng kuryente. \n\nMaraming salamat po.'

b'Date Posted: 16 May 2022\n\nAng pamunuan po ng OEDC ay nais bigyang linaw ang ilang mga isyu na umiikot nitong mga nagdaang araw sa social media.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ang pagtaas ng presyo per kWh ng kuryente ay dahil sa generation at transmission charges na pass-through charges o sinisingil lamang ng OEDC at ibinabayad ng buo sa San Miguel Energy Corporation (SMEC) at Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) para sa supply at National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) para naman sa pag-transmit ng kuryente. Kaugnay dito, ang pagtaas ng generation at transmission rates ay hindi kinakailangang dumaan sa isang public hearing sapagkat may recovery mechanism na itinakda ang Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) sa Resolution No. 16, Series of 2009.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Magkakaroon lamang ng public hearing kung may application ang OEDC para sa rate adjustment ng distribution charge. Ang distribution charge ng OEDC ay hindi nagbabago matapos \nitong aprubahan ng ERC at naipatupad noong June 2018. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ang Universal Charge ay sinisingil ng lahat ng distribution utilities at electric cooperatives sa buong bansa alinsunod sa Section 34 ng EPIRA Law na direktang ibinabayad sa Power Sector Assets and Liabilities (PSALM).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ang System Loss Charge naman ay ang  halaga ng kuryenteng nawawala dahil sa technical losses at non-technical losses na maaari lamang kolektahin ng isang distribution utility at hindi \ndapat humigit sa legal na itinakda ng ERC alinsunod sa RA 7832, Section 10.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ang OEDC po ay hindi nangongolekta ng anumang pagkakautang ng mga consumer sa opisinang dating nagseserbisyo ng kuryente sa lungsod ng Olongapo.\n\nSinisiguro po ng pamunuan ng OEDC na sapat at tuloy-tuloy ang serbisyo ng kuryente sa mga mamamayan ng Lungsod ng Olongapo.\n\nPara sa iba pang katanungan ay maaaring makipag-ugnayan sa aming opisina.
