b'Update\nTime Energized: 4:25PM\n--------------------------------------\nANNOUNCEMENT\nWHAT: IEC EMERGENCY POWER INTERRUPTION\nWHEN: March 27, 2024\nOUTAGE TIME: 2 - 3 HOURS\nAFFECTED AREA(s): \nFEEDER 1 -  Part of Palindan, Part of Talaibon, Adya, Sto.Ni\xc3\xb1o, Tulay, Calamias\nREASON: MANUAL LOAD DROPPING\n\nFor your information and guidance.'
b'ANO NGA BA ANG MANUAL LOAD DROPPING (MLD)??\nAng Manual Load Dropping (MLD) ay ang proseso kung saan idini-distribute ang limitadong supply ng kuryente sa iba\'t ibang lugar at customers.\n\nDahil dito, may ilang mga lugar ang makakaranas ng pansamantalang pagkawala ng supply ng kuryente, at tinatawag itong ROTATIONAL POWER INTERRUPTION.\n\nAng NGCP o System Operator ay ang nag-aabiso sa mga DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES at Electric Cooperatives ng kakulangan ng supply ng kuryente. Ang NGCP din ang nagsasagawa ng tamang\nalokasyon ng supply sa mga Distribution Utilities at Cooperatives.\nBase sa alokasyon ng binigay ng NGCP, ang mga DU\'s tulad ng Ibaan Electric Corporation at ang iba pang mga Cooperatives ay gumagawa ng "Rotating Power Interruption Schedule", upang\nmasiguro na ang system ay mapanatiling stable sa kabila ng limitadong supply.\n\nBAKIT KINAKAILANGANG MAGKAROON NG MANUAL LOAD DROPPING (MLD)??\nIsinasagawa ng NGCP ang sistemang ito kung mayroong kakulangan sa supply ng kuryente sa power plants. Ito ay kadalasang nangyayari sa SUMMER kung saan ay matindi ang init ng panahon o kapag may forced outage ang mga planta ng elektrisidad. Dahil sa mataas na konsumo o demand sa paggamit ng kuryente, nakakaranas ng kakulangan ng supply ang mga planta sa grid. Sa pagsasagawa ng MLD o Rotational Power Interruption, ang NGCP ang nagtatakda kung anu-ano ang mga apektadong lugar, gayundin kung kailan maibabalik ang serbisyo ng kuryente.\n\nBAKIT HINDI ITO KONTROLADO NG IEC AT NG IBA PANG ELECTRIC COOPERATIVES??\nDahil ang kakulangan ng supply ng kuryente ay nagmumula sa Generating Companies o Planta, ang IEC at iba pang distribution utilities ay walang kontrol dito.\n\nAng NGCP ang nagbibigay ng update sa distribution utilities tungkol sa kondisyon sa supply ng kuryente. Sila rin ang tumutukoy sa inaasahang power demand, kaya sila rin ang nagpapasya sa power outage schedules sa mga lugar na maaapektuahan.\n\nPOWER SYSTEM ALERT LEVEL\nWHITE ALERT -Normal ang kondisyon sa supply ng kuryente.\nYELLOW ALERT - Ito ay tumutukoy sa kalagayan ng grid kung saan ang kabuuan ng lahat ng reserba ng kuryente ay mas mababa sa kapasidad ng pinamalaking plantang gumagana.\nRED ALERT - Ito ay tumutukoy sa kalagayan ng grid kapag ang reserba ay zero o nagkaroon na ng kakulangan sa generation. Ito ay maaaring maging sanhi ng shutdown ng mga power plants.\nhttps://ibaanelectric.com/manual-load-dropping-mld/'

The center of MAWAR\xe2\x80\x99s eye is forecast to be within 250 km of the Batanes-Babuyan archipelago by next week during the slowdown period.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 MAWAR is forecast to reach its peak intensity within 24 hours. The super typhoon may slightly weaken by tomorrow evening but is expected to remain as a super typhoon until Monday morning due to highly favorable environment. MAWAR will then weaken at a slightly faster rate by late Monday or Tuesday as unfavorable conditions (e.g., increasing wind shear, cooler sea surface temperature resulting from its slowdown by that time, dry air intrusion) take place.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Current forecast scenario shows that the typhoon may bring heavy rains (which may trigger flooding or rain-induced landslides) over Northern Luzon beginning late Sunday or on Monday next week. In addition, strong to storm-force conditions may be experienced over Extreme Northern Luzon, while strong to gale-force conditions are possible over the northern and eastern portions of Northern Luzon mainland. As a result, wind signals will be raised by tomorrow evening in preparation for these severe winds.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 MAWAR is also forecast to enhance the Southwest Monsoon which may bring monsoon rains over the western portions of Central Luzon, Southern Luzon, and Visayas beginning on Sunday or Monday.\nConsidering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to continue monitoring for updates related to this tropical cyclone.\nUnless an intermediate advisory or initial tropical cyclone bulletin is released, the next tropical cyclone advisory will be issued at 11:00 PM today.\nDOST-PAGASA\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PAGASA.DOST.GOV.PH/posts/pfbid02uZyXxiJf2tu6u7srBJuyrnTXtayWeG6uvyTS5SFPMKe4GozTQidSjoBiNMe3c3f9l'

b'ANO NGA BA ANG MANUAL LOAD DROPPING (MLD)??\n\nAng Manual Load Dropping (MLD) ay ang proseso kung saan idini-distribute ang limitadong supply ng kuryente sa iba\'t ibang lugar at customers.\n\nDahil dito, may ilang mga lugar ang makakaranas ng pansamantalang pagkawala ng supply ng kuryente, at tinatawag itong ROTATIONAL POWER INTERRUPTION.\n\nAng NGCP o System Operator ay ang nag-aabiso sa mga DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES at Electric Cooperatives ng kakulangan ng supply ng kuryente. Ang NGCP din ang nagsasagawa ng tamang\nalokasyon ng supply sa mga Distribution Utilities at Cooperatives.\n\nBase sa alokasyon ng binigay ng NGCP, ang mga DU\'s tulad ng Ibaan Electric Corporation at ang iba pang mga Cooperatives ay gumagawa ng "Rotating Power Interruption Schedule", upang\nmasiguro na ang system ay mapanatiling stable sa kabila ng limitadong supply.\n\nBAKIT KINAKAILANGANG MAGKAROON NG MANUAL LOAD DROPPING (MLD)??\n\nIsinasagawa ng NGCP ang sistemang ito kung mayroong kakulangan sa supply ng kuryente sa power plants. Ito ay kadalasang nangyayari sa SUMMER kung saan ay matindi ang init ng panahon o kapag may forced outage ang mga planta ng elektrisidad. Dahil sa mataas na konsumo o demand sa paggamit ng kuryente, nakakaranas ng kakulangan ng supply ang mga planta sa grid. Sa pagsasagawa ng MLD o Rotational Power Interruption, ang NGCP ang nagtatakda kung anu-ano ang mga apektadong lugar, gayundin kung kailan maibabalik ang serbisyo ng kuryente.\n\nBAKIT HINDI ITO KONTROLADO NG IEC AT NG IBA PANG ELECTRIC COOPERATIVES??\n\nDahil ang kakulangan ng supply ng kuryente ay nagmumula sa Generating Companies o Planta, ang IEC at iba pang distribution utilities ay walang kontrol dito.\n\nAng NGCP ang nagbibigay ng update sa distribution utilities tungkol sa kondisyon sa supply ng kuryente. Sila rin ang tumutukoy sa inaasahang power demand, kaya sila rin ang nagpapasya sa power outage schedules sa mga lugar na maaapektuahan.\n\nPOWER SYSTEM ALERT LEVEL\n\nWHITE ALERT -Normal ang kondisyon sa supply ng kuryente.\n\nYELLOW ALERT - Ito ay tumutukoy sa kalagayan ng grid kung saan ang kabuuan ng lahat ng reserba ng kuryente ay mas mababa sa kapasidad ng pinamalaking plantang gumagana.\n\nRED ALERT - Ito ay tumutukoy sa kalagayan ng grid kapag ang reserba ay zero o nagkaroon na ng kakulangan sa generation. Ito ay maaaring maging sanhi ng shutdown ng mga power plants.\n\nhttps://ibaanelectric.com/manual-load-dropping-mld/'

b'ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nSA AMING MGA KONSUMIDORES,\n\nNALALAPIT NA PAGTAAS NG SINGIL SA KURYENTE\n\nPOWER BILL CHARGES\nPASS THROUGH CHARGES\n\nGeneration Charge \xe2\x80\x93 ang generation charge ay ang singil ng plantang pinagkukunan ng kuryente ng Ibaan Electric Corporation. Ang Ibaan Electric ay taga singil lamang nito at ibabayad sa plantang nag supply ng kuryente.\n\nTransmission Charge \xe2\x80\x93 ang transmission charge ay sinisingil ng National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) para sa serbisyo ng pagpapadaloy ng kuryente mula sa plantang pinagkukunan ng kuryente papunta sa Ibaan Electric Corporation.\n\nOther Charges \xe2\x80\x93 ito ay binubuo ng Taxes, Subsidies/ Discounts at Universal Charges. Ang Ibaan Electric Corporation ay taga singil lamang nito at ibabayad sa iba\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x93 ibang ahensya.\n\nIEC CHARGE\nDistribution Charge \xe2\x80\x93 Distribution, Supply and Metering System Charge: \nIto lamang ang bayarin na napupunta sa Ibaan Electric Corporation.

Giyera sa pagitan ng Russia at Ukraine\na. Ang patuloy na kaguluhan sa pagitan ng dalawang bansa ay patuloy na ding nakakaapekto sa pagtaas ng ng presyo ng coal at fuel na ginagamit upang makapag suplay ng kuryente.\n\n2. Mataas na Inflation Rate at Foreign Exchange Rate\na. Ang pagbaba ng palitan ng piso kontra dolyar ay nakaapekto sa presyo ng binibiling coal at fuel sa world market. Ito ay dahil dolyar ang ipinambabayad ng mga planta ng kuryente upang makabili ng mga produktong ito.\nb. Epekto din ng inflation rate ang pagtaas ng iba\xe2\x80\x99t ibang produkto at serbisyo.\n\nhttps://ibaanelectric.com/nalalapit-na-pagtaas-ng-singil-sa-kuryente/'

On the forecast track, KARDING will likely make landfall in the vicinity of the northern portion of Quezon or the southern portion of Aurora tonight. The possibility of an earlier (afternoon) landfall or close approach in the vicinity of Polillo Islands is not ruled out. \n\xe2\x80\xa2 For the remainder of this evening post-landfall through tomorrow early morning, KARDING will traverse the landmass of Central Luzon and emerge over the West Philippine Sea via the coastal waters of Zambales or Pangasinan. The typhoon will then continue tracking generally westward over the West Philippine Sea for the remainder of the forecast period.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 KARDING is forecast to continue intensifying and may make landfall at or near a peak intensity of 185-205 km/h. Frictional effects during landfall and traverse of the Luzon landmass will weaken KARDING throughout the evening through tomorrow early morning, although it is highly likely that this tropical cyclone will remain a typhoon while crossing the landmass. \n\nConsidering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to take all necessary measures to protect life and property. Persons living in areas identified to be highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards are advised to follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials. For heavy rainfall warnings, thunderstorm/rainfall advisories, and other severe weather information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your local PAGASA Regional Services Division.\n\nThe next tropical cyclone bulletin will be issued at 5:00 PM today. \n \nDOST-PAGASA\n\nLink: bit.ly/3cXQPjd'

Moderate to heavy with at times intense rains over the Bicol Region, Zamboanga Peninsula, Quezon, and the rest of MIMAROPA. Light to moderate with at times heavy rains over the Metro Manila, Cagayan Valley, Cordillera Administrative Region, Caraga, Northern Mindanao, Aurora, Lanao del Sur, and the rest of Visayas,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Tomorrow: Heavy to torrential rains over Kalayaan Islands. Moderate to heavy rains over Catanduanes, Camarines Provinces, Quezon, and Aurora. Light to moderate with at times heavy rains over Cagayan Valley, Cordillera Administrative Region, Metro Manila, Eastern Visayas, Rizal, Bulacan, mainland Palawan including Calamian Islands, and the rest of Bicol Region.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Under these conditions, scattered to widespread flooding (including flash floods) and rain-induced landslides are expected especially in areas that are highly or very highly susceptible to these hazard as identified in hazard maps, and in localities with significant antecedent rainfall.\nSevere Winds\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Destructive typhoon-force winds will be experienced within any of the areas where TCWS #3 is in effect. This may bring moderate to heavy damage to structures and vegetation.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Damaging winds reaching gale- to storm-force strength will be experienced within any of the areas where TCWS #2 is in effect. This may result in generally light to moderate damage to structures and vegetation.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Strong winds (strong breeze to near gale) with higher gusts will be experienced within any of the areas where TCWS #1 is currently in effect during the passage of the typhoon. This may generally bring up to very light damage to structures and vegetation.\nCoastal Inundation\nThere is a moderate to high risk of storm surge of up to 3.0 m in height in the next 24 hours which may cause life-threatening flooding in the low-lying coastal areas of Negros Provinces, Iloilo, Antique, Guimaras, and several localities in the northern portion of Palawan (including Calamian, Cuyo and Cagayancillo Islands).\nHAZARDS AFFECTING COASTAL WATERS\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In the next 24 hours, moderate to very high seas (1.2 to 10.0 m) will be experienced over the seaboards of areas where TCWS is in effect (especially in the open sea areas). These conditions are risky for all types of sea vessels. Mariners are advised to remain in port or take shelter in port until winds and waves subside.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Under the influence of Typhoon \xe2\x80\x9cODETTE\xe2\x80\x9d and the prevailing Northeast Monsoon, a Gale Warning remains in effect for several coastal waters not under any wind signal, specifically the seaboards of Northern Luzon, and the eastern seaboard of the country. For more information, refer to Gale Warning #51 (Intermediate) issued at 8:00 AM today.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In the next 24 hours, moderate to rough seas (1.2 to 3.1 m) will also prevail over the remaining seaboards of the country that are not under any wind signal. These conditions are risky for those using small seacrafts. Mariners are advised to take precautionary measures when venturing out to sea and, if possible, avoid navigating in these conditions.   \nTRACK AND INTENSITY OUTLOOK\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Moving generally westward, the typhoon is forecast to make landfall in the vicinity of northern or central portion of Palawan this morning or afternoon, re-emerge over the West Philippine Sea tonight, and pass in the vicinity of Kalayaan Islands tomorrow. The typhoon is forecast to exit the Philippine Area of Responsibility tomorrow morning or early afternoon.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x9cODETTE\xe2\x80\x9d may still see some slight weakening until it crosses Palawan, but it is forecast to remain as a typhoon. Re-intensification is likely once \xe2\x80\x9cODETTE\xe2\x80\x9d emerges over the West Philippine Sea. However, continuous weakening may ensue beginning Sunday as the typhoon becomes exposed to increasing vertical wind shear and the surge of the Northeast Monsoon.\nConsidering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to take all necessary measures to protect life and property. Persons living in areas identified to be highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards are advised to follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials. For heavy rainfall warnings, thunderstorm/rainfall advisories, and other severe weather information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your local PAGASA Regional Services Division.\nThe next tropical cyclone bulletin will be issued at 11:00 AM today. \nDOST-PAGASA"

Moderate to heavy with at times intense rains are also likely over Aurora, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac, Zambales, Albay, Sorsogon, northern Palawan, Aklan, Antique, Capiz, Iloilo, and Guimaras. \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Under these conditions, scattered to widespread flooding (including flash floods) and rain-induced landslides are highly likely especially in areas that are highly or very highly susceptible to these hazard as identified in hazard maps.\nSevere Winds\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Damaging gale-force to storm-force winds are likely to occur within any of the areas where TCWS #2 is in effect. This may bring generally light to moderate damage to structures and vegetation.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Strong winds (strong breeze to near gale conditions) with occasional gusts will be experienced in areas where Tropical Cyclone Wind Signal (TCWS) #1 is in effect. This may result to up to very light damage to structures and vegetation.\n\nCoastal Inundation\nIn the next 24 hours, storm surge of up to 1.5 m over several coastal areas of Quezon may result in coastal inundation which may pose threat to life and property. In addition, coastal areas of localities under TCWS, especially those at #2 may also experience coastal flooding due to hazardous surf conditions.\nHAZARDS AFFECTING COASTAL WATERS\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In the next 24 hours, Severe Tropical Storm \xe2\x80\x9cJOLINA\xe2\x80\x9d will bring rough to very rough seas (2.5 to 5.0 m) over the seaboards of areas where TCWS #2 is in effect. Sea travel is risky for all types of seacrafts over these waters. Mariners without the proper experience should immediately seek safe harbor.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Moderate to rough seas (1.2 to 2.8 m) will be experienced over the seaboards of areas where TCWS #1 is in effect and the remaining seaboards of Visayas. Mariners of small seacrafts are advised to take precautionary measures when venturing out to sea. Inexperienced mariners should avoid navigating in these conditions.\nTRACK AND INTENSITY OUTLOOK\n\xe2\x80\xa2 On the forecast track, \xe2\x80\x9cJOLINA\xe2\x80\x9d is forecast to move over the Tayabas Bay and make another landfall in the vicinity of eastern Batangas this morning. However, due to the recent southwestward trend in the shift of track forecasts, the possibility of landfall in the vicinity of northern Oriental Mindoro is not ruled out at this time. Afterwards, the storm will cross the Batangas-Cavite area before emerging over Manila Bay tonight. This will be followed by another landfall in the vicinity of Bataan Peninsula. Frictional effects during its traverse of mainland Luzon will weaken \xe2\x80\x9cJOLINA\xe2\x80\x9d down to tropical storm category.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x9cJOLINA\xe2\x80\x9d is forecast to emerge over the West Philippine Sea on tomorrow morning. Re-intensification is forecast to occur beginning tomorrow afternoon as the tropical cyclone moves west northwestward over the West Philippine Sea towards the southern China-northern Vietnam area.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This tropical cyclone is forecast to exit the Philippine Area of Responsibility on Friday morning.\n\nConsidering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to take all necessary measures to protect life and property. Persons living in areas identified to be highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards are advised to follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials. For heavy rainfall warnings, thunderstorm/rainfall advisories, and other severe weather information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your local PAGASA Regional Services Division.\n\nThe next tropical cyclone bulletin will be issued at 8:00 AM today.\n\nLink: http://bit.ly/3eujmdC\nDOST-PAGASA'

b'Ano ba ang Manual Load Dropping? \n\nAng Manual Load Dropping (MLD) o rotational power interruption ay ang proseso kung saan idini-distribute ang limitadong supply ng kuryente sa iba\xe2\x80\x99t ibang lugar at customers. Dahil dito, may ilang mga lugar ang makakaranas ng pansamantalang power interruption. Tinawag itong rotational power interruption dahil may takdang oras kung kailan mawawala at maibabalik ang kuryente sa isang lugar. \n\nAng NGCP o System Operator ay ang nag aabiso sa mga DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES at Electric Cooperatives ng kakulangan sa supply ng kuryente. Ang NGCP din ang nagsasagawa ng tamang alokasyon ng supply sa mga DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES at Cooperatives. \n\nBase sa alokasyon na binigay ng NGCP, ang mga DU\xe2\x80\x99s tulad ng Ibaan Electric at ang iba pang mga Cooperative ay gumagawa ng rotating power interruption schedule upang masiguro na ang system ay mapapanatiling stable sa kabila ng limitadong supply. \n\nAno ang ibig sabihin ng Grid Status? \n\nYELLOW ALERT Ito ay tumutukoy sa kalagayan ng grid kung saan ang kabuuan ng lahat ng reserba ng kuryente ay mas mababa kaysa sa kapasidad ng pinakamalaking plantang gumagana.\n\nRED ALERT Ito ay tumutukoy sa kalagayan ng grid kapag ang reserba ay zero o nagkakaroon na ng kakulangan sa generation. Ito ay maaring maging sanhi ng shutdown ng mga power plants, pagbawas ng mga kapasidad ng iba, o pagtaas ng pangangalangan ng mga consumer.'
