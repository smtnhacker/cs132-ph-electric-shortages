Janeene Depay-Colingan, executive director and general manager of PHILRECA, the national association of electric cooperatives in the country, explained that electric cooperatives have been \xe2\x80\x9cmaligned, crucified, and even tried in the court of public opinion\xe2\x80\x9d for collecting increasing rates of electricity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ECs may be the collectors or collecting agents of the payments due to generation companies, the transmission systems operator, and even the taxes due to the government, but I assure you that we never benefit from any increases in electricity rates,\xe2\x80\x9d clarified Colingan.\n\nShe also added that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you pay your bills, the only amount that goes to the electric cooperatives is the one reflected in the distribution-supply-metering (or DSM) charges. This amount is fixed by law, regulated, and can only increase or decrease after public consultation and deliberation, as well as approval by the ERC.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nColingan also provided a chart showing different components of a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s electric bill and where the bulk of the payments go: 61% to generation charge, 7% to transmission charge, 18% to taxes, subsidies, and other charges, and with only 14% going to distribution charge.\n\nShe highlighted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe DSM rate [distribution charges] never changed before and during the pandemic, not in the last 10 years or since 2010! Inuulit ko po, hindi nagbago ang DSM rate \xe2\x80\x93 ang halaga na naka-karga sa inyong mga billing statement na napupunta sa mga electric cooperatives \xe2\x80\x93 since 2010! Kung may pagtaas po ng presyo ng kuryente, iyan ay dahil sa pagtaas ng ibang components tulad ng generation charge.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn the side of the consumers, PHABDREC (Philippine Association of Board of Directors of Electric Cooperatives) President Atty. Gloria Corrales said that electric cooperatives have Board of Directors elected by the member-consumer-owners to protect their welfare and interests, in the same way that we elect our legislators who pass laws for the welfare of the Filipinos.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs representatives of the member-consumer-owners, the Board of Directors certainly do not want to be burdened with higher electricity prices. We will not agree to any Power Supply Agreements that will be detrimental to the welfare of the people that we serve,\xe2\x80\x9d said Corrales. \n\nPower Supply Agreements are the contracts entered into by electric cooperatives and their power supplier (generation companies) in the provision of electricity that the ECs will eventually distribute to the consumers. Such PSAs are a result of deliberations and consultations and are approved by the Energy Regulatory Commission or ERC. PSA contains provisions on payment terms, rates, allowable adjustments, and others. \n\nCorrales said that \xe2\x80\x9cback when some PSAs were approved, the cheapest and more affordable sources of power is coal and we have enjoyed this for years!\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut things happened, international conflicts erupted, exportation of coal was banned in certain countries, supply was immensely reduced, and these factors affected the cost of generating electricity,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Corrales. \n\nShe further explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Electric Power Industry Reform Act or EPIRA allows certain costs incurred by generation companies to be passed on to consumers and this is what makes electricity cost higher.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBoth PHIRECA and PHABDREC expressed their support for legislators\xe2\x80\x99 call for an inquiry so that necessary amendments to the EPIRA \xe2\x80\x93 which they hope will lessen the cost of electricity to be paid by consumers \xe2\x80\x93 can be implemented. \n\nThey appealed, however, that the legislators look not only into the distribution sector but the entire power supply chain including and especially the generation and transmission sectors, as well as the taxes being collected by the government on these components. \n\nThe conference was also participated in by leaders of other consumer groups as well as APEC Party-List Representative Sergio Dagooc who laid down their legislative agenda on how the power crisis can hopefully be addressed.\n\n#PowerOn #ParaSaOneECMCOMovement'

b'Para sa kabatiran ng ating mga Member-Consumer-Owners ng PANELCO III patungkol sa bayarin sa kuryente ngayong buwan ng Hulyo 2022.\n\nEFFECTIVE UNBUNDLED RATE FOR JULY 2022\nResidential Customers = Php 16.1755 / kWh\n\nTumaas ng 1.1806 kada kWh mula sa 14.9949 kWh ng buwan ng Hunyo 2022 o katumbas ng Php118.06 kada 100kWh na konsumo sa kuryente para sa mga Residential Customers. Ang pagtaas sa taripa ng kuryente ngayong buwan ay bunsod ng pagtaas sa Generation System Charge na umabot ng Php .9936 kada kWh particular na ang San Miguel Electric Corporation (SMEC) ng 7.09% at Independent Electricity Market Operators of the Philippines (IEMOP) ng 166.14 %.\n\nBukod dito, ang pagtaas din ng Cost of Fuel Rate ng ating mga Power Suppliers ay lubhang naka apekto para tumaas ang taripa ng kuryente sa merkado tulad na lamang sa GN Power Mariveles Energy Center Ltd. Co. (GMEC) na tumaas ng 25.20%, San Miguel Electric Corporation na may pagtaas ng 31.95% at Masinloc Power Partners Company, Limited ng 27.31%. Maging ang average market price sa IEMOP ay tumaas ng 2.49%.\n\nNagkaroon din ng pagtaas sa Transmission System Charge ng Php 0.0071 kada kWh na binubuo ng Transmission Cost, Transmission Vat at Ancillary Services Charge. Bunsod sa pagtaas sa Generation System Charge at Transmission System Charge ay ang dahilan din ng pagtaas sa ating System Loss Charge ng Php.0082 kada kWh.\n\nGayunpaman, muli aming ipinapaalala na ang Generation at Transmission Charge ay mga pass-on charges lamang na binabayaran. Sa kabila ng pagtaas o pagbaba ng taripa ng kuryente, patuloy pa rin na pinapayuhan ang mga MCOs na panatilihin ang tama at wastong paggamit ng kuryente upang maiwasan ang pagbabayad ng mataas na konsumo sa kuryente.\n\nMaraming Salamat po.'

b'Para sa kabatiran ng ating mga Member-Consumer-Owners ng PANELCO III patungkol sa bayarin sa kuryente ngayong buwan ng Hunyo 2022. \n\nTumaas ng Php 1.4769 kada kWh mula sa Php 13.5180 kWh o katumbas ng Php147.69 kada 100kWh na konsumo sa kuryente para sa mga Residential Customers.  Ang pagtaas sa taripa ng kuryente ngayong buwan ay bunsod ng pagtaas sa Generation System Charge na umabot ng Php 1.1177 kada kWh particular na ang San Miguel Electric Corporation (SMEC) ng 2.86% at Independent Electricity Market Operators of the Philippines (IEMOP) ng 15.36%. \nBukod dito, ang pagtaas din ng Cost of Fuel Rate ng ating mga Power Suppliers ay lubhang naka apekto para tumaas ang taripa ng kuryente sa merkado tulad na lamang sa GN Power Mariveles Energy Center Ltd. Co. (GMEC) na tumaas ng 35.04%, San Miguel Electric Corporation na may pagtaas ng 8.71% at Masinloc Power Partners Company, Limited ng 2.49%. Maging ang average market price sa Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) ay tumaas ng 9.92%.\n\nNagkaroon din ng pagtaas sa Transmission System Charge ng Php 0.6878 kada kWh na binubuo ng Transmission Cost, Transmission Vat at Ancillary Services Charge. Ang pagtaas sa Generation System Charge at Transmission System Charge ay nagdulot  din ng pagtaas sa ating System Loss Charge ng Php1.1673 kada kWh.\n\nGayunpaman, muli aming ipinapaalala na ang Generation at Transmission Charge ay mga pass-on charges lamang na binabayaran. Sa kabila ng pagtaas o pagbaba ng taripa ng kuryente, patuloy pa rin na pinapayuhan ang mga MCOs na panatilihin ang tama at wastong paggamit ng kuryente upang maiwasan ang pagbabayad ng mataas na konsumo sa kuryente.\n\nMaraming Salamat po.'
